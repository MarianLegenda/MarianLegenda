- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariusz
- 👀 I’m interested in React, JS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project

Hello,
My name is Mariusz and I have A LOT of professional experience, but none of it is
(so far) related to programming or coding.
Despite of being very successful with my current profesional field, i decided that its
time for a change. I started to learn React and JavaScript to become React Developer in
future.
Currently i am spending approx 3-5 hours / day to learn and write new projects.
You can check my progress on my GitHub account (link below).
So far i have finished several courses on Udemy, EduWeb, and Pluralsight, I am also
doing daily tasks on Edabit (webpage which is similar to Code Wars or Leet Code), trying to
write my own projects etc.
My main goal for incoming year (years) is to focus on learning React and JS. I want to
become proficient in those fields and be a valuable asset in any team.
I am highly motivated professional who wants to put all efforts into new role. This means
that I will do my best to learn as quickly as possible to obtain skills that are enough to perform
independent tasks. I am resilient to stress and can work hard. In my previous career as a
manager i was responsible for building and managing different teams across international
corporations (pls. check my CV for more reference). That`s why i am confident that i am a good
team player and I am always acting in teams best interest

Thank You and Best Regards
Mariusz Jachymczak
