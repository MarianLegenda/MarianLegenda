- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariusz
- 👀 I’m interested in React, JS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project

Hi There,
First of all:  please don`t check my CV before You go through this cover letter. Why ? Because even though i have almost 20 years of professional  experience, none is related to programming or coding.
So, My name is Mariusz and I am 44 years old. 
Half year ago i decided to pivot my career in a different direction.  I started to learn React and JS to become React Developer in future. 
So far i have finished several courses on Udemy, EduWeb, and Pluralsight, I am also doing daily tasks on Edabit (something like Code Wars or Leet Code), trying to write my own projects etc. 
My main goal for incoming year (years) is to focus on learning React and JS. I want to become proficient in those fields and be a valuable asset in any team. 
I am highly motivated professional who wants to put all efforts into new role. This means that i will do my best to learn as quickly as possible to obtain skills that are enough to perform tasks within organisation. I am resilient to stress and can work hard. In my previous career as a manager i was responsible for building and managing different teams across  international corporations (pls. check my CV for more reference). That`s why i am confident that i am a good team player and I am always acting in teams best interest

I hope this short introduction will be enough to contact with me. 

Thank You and Best Regards
Mariusz Jachymczak
